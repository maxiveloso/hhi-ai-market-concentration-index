## Key Findings Summary

**Market Concentration Level**: **HIGH** (consistently above 2,500 HHI points)

**HHI Results by Quarter:**
- Q3 2024: 2,857 points
- Q4 2024: 2,851 points  
- Q1 2025: 2,852 points
- Q2 2025: 2,845 points

**Trigger Alert**: Sustained high concentration for 4 quarters triggers "audit_access_practices" recommendation.

## Methodology Validation

✅ **Composite Market Definition**: Hardware (40%) + Inference (60%) dimensions  
✅ **Entity Mapping**: 7 vertically integrated entities identified  
✅ **Vertical Integration Adjustment**: No entity met >30% threshold in both dimensions  
✅ **Sensitivity Analysis**: ±60% scenarios provide uncertainty bands  
✅ **Source Traceability**: All calculations linked to source data with hashes  
✅ **Professional Standards**: Replicable methodology with documented assumptions

## Data Quality Assessment

**Hardware Dimension**: High reliability - based on SEC filings and unit shipments
**Inference Dimension**: Medium reliability - triangulation from multiple sources required
**Overall Confidence**: Medium - appropriate uncertainty bands provided

## Regulatory Implications

The sustained high concentration levels (>2,500 HHI for 4 quarters) suggest the market warrants:
- Enhanced monitoring of competitive practices
- Evaluation of interoperability requirements  
- Assessment of supply chain diversification needs
- Consideration of regulatory frameworks for AI infrastructure access
