**Immediate Horizon (0-90 days): Diagnosis**

* **Real switching costs audit:** Measure the time and cost to migrate 10 critical use cases (fine-tunes, agents, data pipelines) between the top 3 providers. Create a public benchmark with a reproducible methodology.  
* **Vendor lock-in clause mapping:** Legal analysis of ToS, EULAs, and enterprise contracts that restrict benchmarking, portability, or independent auditing. Publish a provider-specific "openness index."  
* **Dependency stress test:** Simulate a service interruption from the dominant provider in 5 critical sectors (health, education, media, research, public administration). Measure recovery time and contingency costs.

**Tactical Horizon (90 days-12 months): Incentive Redesign**

* **Public procurement as leverage:** Condition AI contracts \>â‚¬5M on audited APIs, certified portability, and disclosure of rationing criteria. This isn't protectionism; it's smart buying.  
* **Corrective taxation:** A 3% tax on AI revenue for providers with \>25% market share, to be used to fund evaluation commons and independent research sandboxes.  
* **Interoperability as a right:** Mandatory technical standard for exporting fine-tunes, agents, and training data. Fines for unjustified technical lock-in.

**Strategic Horizon (1-3 years): Alternative Infrastructure**

* **Public compute commons:** Coordinated EU-LATAM investment in sovereign compute capacity for critical use cases. Not about competing on everything, but about securing alternatives in essential areas.  
* **Mandatory open standards:** Content credentials (C2PA), watermarking, and evals with real multi-stakeholder governance, not vendor-captured consortiums.  
* **Operational post-GDP metrics:** A "distributed cognitive capacity" index that measures effective access to frontier tools, not just aggregate spending.
